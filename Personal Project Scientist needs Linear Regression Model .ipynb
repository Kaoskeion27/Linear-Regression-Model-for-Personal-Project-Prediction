    "# A scientist who has been hired by the local fast food joint to build their newest ball pit in the play area. As such, they are working on researching the bounciness of different balls so as to optimize the pit. They are running an experiment to bounce different sizes of bouncy balls, and then fitting lines to the data points they record. \n",

A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the error, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of best fit.\n",
